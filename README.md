# LLM Tutorials

Welcome to the LLM Tutorials repository! This repository contains various tutorials on large language models (LLMs) designed to complement the blog posts hosted on [sajalsharma.com](https://sajalsharma.com/posts/). Each tutorial is organized inside its own directory, under the `blog_posts` directory for now.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

cd llm_tutorials
```

### 2. Install uv

If you haven't installed uv yet, you can do so using the official installer:

```

Verify the installation:

## Running a Tutorial

1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the tutorial directory:
```bash
cd blog_posts/tutorial_name
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies:
```bash
uv venv    # Create a virtual environment in the directory
uv pip install -r requirements.txt  # OR: use uv sync if you maintain a lockfile
```

> Note: If the tutorial has a `pyproject.toml` (most of them do), you can also run:
```bash
uv sync  # Install the project with its dependencies
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the tutorial:

For example, if the tutorial is in a jupyter notebook, you can run:
```bash
uv jupyter notebook
```

Open the tutorial notebook in your browser and run the cells.

When finished, close Jupyter Notebook (`Ctrl+C` in terminal).
