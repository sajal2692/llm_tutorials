## Building a Corrective RAG Workflow with LangGraph

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a corrective RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) workflow using LangGraph, improving on traditional RAG systems by implementing feedback mechanisms.

## Technologies Used

- LangGraph - For building the workflow graph
- LangChain - For document retrieval and processing
- OpenAI - For embeddings and LLM capabilities
- ChromaDB - For vector storage
