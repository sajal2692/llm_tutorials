The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by Bolton Wanderers\\' reserve team. By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the league\\'s dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the \"LYR\" from its name. After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.\\n\\nIn January 1902, with debts of £2,670 '),\n",

They trained at the club\\'s training ground, The Cliff, and arranged matches against other clubs\\' unofficial women\\'s teams.\\nManchester United Supporters Club Ladies began operations in the late 1970s and was unofficially recognised as the club\\'s senior women\\'s team. In their earliest form they were a charity team that played fundraising matches and played its first game in October 1977. In 1979, the team joined the Three Counties League under the auspices of the Women\\'s Football Association and started playing competitively. With the league covering a large area, United\\'s committee campaigned for a local league and in 1982 the Women\\'s FA approved the creation of the Manchester & District League, of which Manchester United Supporters Club Ladies was a founding member and won the first three seasons. In 1989, the combined Manchester & Merseyside League, North West Women\\'s League, and the Three Counties League merged to form the North West Women\\'s Regional Football League. The league was spread across four divisions and included 42 teams. At the same time, the team approached Manchester United F.C. for support and more formal backing. The club agreed and the team was allowed to use the name Manchester United Ladies FC, matches were advertised in the club\\'s programme and the team was allowed to train at The Cliff. The team became increasingly competitive throughout the 1990s at various levels of the FA Women\\'s National League up until 2001.\\n\\n\\n=== 2001–2005: Partnership and disbandment ===\\n\\nIn 2001, the team formed an official partnership with Manchester United. However, the club began to stagnate with a string of successive mid-table finishes in the third division. The team were disbanded four years later, in 2005, shortly after Malcolm Glazer\\'s completed takeover with the new regime deeming the women\\'s team to not be part of the \"core business\" and unprofitable. A media spokesman for Manchester United also claimed the club wanted to focus on its women\\'s academy instead of its senior team.\\n\\n\\n=== 2018–present: Current team ===\\n\\nIn March 2018, Manchester United announced their intentions to reintroduce a women\\'s football team. Manchester United Women Football Club were founded on 28 May 2018, following the club\\'s successful application to join the newly-formed 2018–19 FA Women\\'s Championship. It marked the club\\'s return to women\\'s football after a thirteen-year absence; though the club\\'s academy continued via the Manchester United Foundation, with the likes of Izzy Christiansen and Katie Zelem being produced by United\\'s Centre of Excellence academy. Casey Stoney was appointed as the club\\'s first head coach on 8 June, with their inaugural 21-player squad announced just over a month later.\\nThe team\\'s first game back was on 19 August 2018, where they won 1–0 in an away game against Liverpool in the FA Women\\'s League Cup, with Lizzie Arnot scoring their first competitive goal in thirteen years. Three weeks later, their opening Championship encounter ended in a 12–0 victory away to Aston Villa. On 17 April 2019, United secured promotion to the FA Women\\'s Super League following a 5–0 win against the same opposition.
